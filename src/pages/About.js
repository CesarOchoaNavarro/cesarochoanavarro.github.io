            <p>Computer Science Major - Associate Software Engineer</p>
            <p>
              Hi, I'm Cesar and I am a fourth year Computer Science student at Portland State University.
              I am experienced in various programming languages like Python, C++, Java, and more as well as experience in other areas like Pandas, NumPy, and Keras to name a few.
              Iâ€™m looking to further my programming experience and knowledge through connections and learning experiences.
              I recently accepted a position as a Associate Software Engineer and am excited
              for what lies ahead!
            </p>
